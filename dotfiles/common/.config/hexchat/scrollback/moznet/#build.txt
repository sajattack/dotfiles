T 1507910191 18<ted18>	i still think you might have a better time just putting release symbols in a separate dir
T 1507910218 18<ted18>	you could write a script that downloads the current firefox release, runs symchk to fetch its symbols to a directory, then runs agestore or whatever to clean up old stuff
T 1507910236 18<dmajor18>	I want to have just a single way that I fetch symbols
T 1507910236 18<ted18>	and let the debugger manage its own cache for everything else
T 1507910275 18<ted18>	well then i think you're over-constraining the problem :)
T 1507910316 18<dmajor18>	 /shrug. doesn't seem that constraining to me.
