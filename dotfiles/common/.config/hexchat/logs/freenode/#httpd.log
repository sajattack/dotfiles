Sep 20 20:14:29 <sajattack>	I have a nextcloud site that works on http but not https
Sep 20 20:14:47 <sajattack>	http://owncloud.paulsajna.com https://owncloud.paulsajna.com
Sep 20 20:14:57 <sajattack>	certs are from letsencrypt
Sep 20 20:15:12 <sajattack>	404s on the https version
Sep 20 20:15:15 <sajattack>	http://termbin.com/ipq9
Sep 20 20:15:20 <sajattack>	^ access.log
Sep 20 20:16:58 <thumbs>	sajattack: What does the error log say, exactly?
Sep 20 20:17:15 <sajattack>	nothing in /var/log/apache2/error.log
Sep 20 20:17:18 *	RoyK (~roy@unaffiliated/royk) has joined
Sep 20 20:17:29 <thumbs>	sajattack: on 2.4, try increasing the log level.
Sep 20 20:17:45 <sajattack>	how?
Sep 20 20:18:02 <thumbs>	sajattack: with a text editor.
Sep 20 20:18:15 <sajattack>	edit what?
Sep 20 20:18:30 <thumbs>	sajattack: the appropriate config file, naturally.
Sep 20 20:19:34 <sajattack>	what level should I set it to?
Sep 20 20:19:52 <sajattack>	debug?
Sep 20 20:19:53 <fajita>	http://httpd.apache.org/dev/debugging.html
Sep 20 20:19:57 <thumbs>	sajattack: increase the current verbosity.
Sep 20 20:20:12 <sajattack>	I don't have a loglevel directive atm
Sep 20 20:20:24 <thumbs>	sajattack: you probably do. See man grep
Sep 20 20:20:54 <sajattack>	I'll just set it to debug and see what happens
Sep 20 20:20:54 <thumbs>	or you can define it in your vhost.
Sep 20 20:21:26 <sajattack>	termbin.com/qi0z btw
Sep 20 20:21:46 <thumbs>	sajattack: terrific.
Sep 20 20:22:53 <sajattack>	still nothing recent in error.log
Sep 20 20:23:22 <thumbs>	sajattack: as a side note, you want to set AllowOverride none in every <Directory> block - you don't want .htaccess files to interfere.
Sep 20 20:23:45 <sajattack>	mmkay
Sep 20 20:25:22 <sajattack>	that made it worse
Sep 20 20:25:28 <thumbs>	sajattack: ok!
Sep 20 20:26:52 <sajattack>	I'm gonna try regenerating the ssl config with letsencrypt
Sep 20 20:26:58 <thumbs>	sajattack: ok!
Sep 20 20:28:22 <opsec>	sajattack: that will be about as effective as rebooting.. i.e. not effective at all.
Sep 20 20:28:51 <sajattack>	I'm updating to the latest letsencrypt as well, I had a pretty old version
Sep 20 20:29:04 <opsec>	irrelevant
Sep 20 20:29:05 <fajita>	This factoid has no relevance to anything. Please select another factoid.
Sep 20 20:29:12 <sajattack>	lol
Sep 20 20:32:48 <sajattack>	you're right
Sep 20 20:34:40 <opsec>	your site loads just fine by the way, you need to configure nextcloud to work as ssl, which requires activating and configuring an ssl module in the backend and editing the config file if i recall
Sep 20 20:35:11 <opsec>	also, you'll want to redirect all :80 -> :443 and use hsts
Sep 20 20:35:45 <sajattack>	yeah I don't have it redirecting for now just because http is working and https isn't
Sep 20 20:36:52 <opsec>	look in your backend and the config file for your app and search their site for any extra instructions when moving it.. which is essentially what you're doing. also, it's not a problem with #httpd most likely
Sep 20 20:37:42 <sajattack>	yeah that's what I though but they told me to try here
Sep 20 20:38:47 <opsec>	https://help.nextcloud.com/t/moving-nextcloud-installation-from-one-domain-to-another/4303
Sep 20 20:40:45 <opsec>	otherwise, unless you can provide relevant error log messages from httpd, that's the extent of what we can offer here
Sep 20 20:41:42 <sajattack>	alright
Sep 20 20:43:07 <sajattack>	tried changing the config file to no avail
Sep 20 20:43:15 <sajattack>	and the nextcloud guys insist it's your fault :P
Sep 20 20:44:01 <opsec>	you mean *your* fault.
