Mar 14 13:31:52 <grawity>	like that?
Mar 14 13:32:05 <earnestly>	Seems fine
Mar 14 13:32:10 *	fernie has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Mar 14 13:32:11 <grawity>	actually, is there a bug report about it
Mar 14 13:32:56 <earnestly>	More specifically mentioning nvidia-libgl and/or libglvnd would be useful.  There's front page news if a url is needed
Mar 14 13:32:56 <grawity>	I've heard that nvidia's libglvnd thingy seems to break nvidia's drivers, but that's about it
Mar 14 13:33:18 <grawity>	earnestly: yeah the front page just says "foo is now in testing"
Mar 14 13:33:23 <beest>	i feel left out, my nvidia box is a thousand miles away so i don't get to whinge about it
Mar 14 13:33:38 <grawity>	earnestly: and claims it's an "out-of-the-box working experience"

Mar 14 13:34:14 <freechips>	this is verbose
Mar 14 13:34:14 <grawity>	isn't that just `export DRI_PRIME=1`?
Mar 14 13:34:24 <earnestly>	grawity: The title is a bit confusing when it's no longer in [testing]

Mar 14 13:35:35 <linux_dream>	hi people is there a way to check which kernels were installed on a system or does pacman auto purges old kernel cache and stuff
Mar 14 13:35:41 <Ali_Waris>	simplefied: installing gvfs now detects my pendrive, but still my mobile phone is not getting detected.

Mar 14 13:36:12 <teraflops>	disconnect3d: sure, I had to reinstall nvidia + bumblebee 
Mar 14 13:36:29 <teraflops>	disconnect3d: apart from that all is fine so far
Mar 14 13:36:30 <earnestly>	linux_dream: I.e. there's no reason to basically take package management out of the package manager's control
Mar 14 13:36:31 <Ali_Waris>	simplefied: lets see if it solves the problem
Mar 14 13:36:32 <MacGyver>	linux_dream: Why do you want this?

Mar 14 13:37:13 <earnestly>	linux_dream: Your question doesn't make a lot of sense.  You want to check if linux, linux-zen, linux-grsec, and so on are installed?
Mar 14 13:37:15 <linux_dream>	thanks good option
Mar 14 13:37:34 <grawity>	freechips: hmm, well, considering this is about arch-ARM
Mar 14 13:37:36 <linux_dream>	no earnestly , i wanted to check which versions of linux were installed
Mar 14 13:37:39 <earnestly>	You want to check the current installed version?  You want to check the running kernel version?
Mar 14 13:37:47 <earnestly>	linux_dream: There's only one.
Mar 14 13:37:49 <linux_dream>	all previously installed versions
Mar 14 13:37:52 <grawity>	freechips: are you sure the "no modules added" wasn't caused by them *compiling in* all that stuff which used to be modular?

Sep 17 14:06:29 <stef204>	question is: I guess my swap partition is being counted as a primary partition? My idea to fix is the extend the extended partition to the left to include the unallocated space (8GB) and then recreate my swap partition inside a logical volume in the extended partition
Sep 17 14:06:30 <lmat>	grawity: pacman -S mkfs.vfat; package not found; is that what you were recommending?
Sep 17 14:06:37 <grawity>	no

Sep 17 14:08:41 <sudokode>	where's the left side of that expression...
Sep 17 14:08:49 <stef204>	so anyway, can i safely resize the extended (only the extended) to the left? Then recreate my swap partition inside the extended partition?

Sep 17 14:09:05 <sudokode>	all that for a swap partition?

Sep 17 14:09:24 <lmat>	eschwartz: grawity: Thanks!

Sep 17 14:11:08 <sudokode>	tropical storm watch?
Sep 17 14:11:21 <sudokode>	dafuq
Sep 17 14:11:21 <stef204>	sudokode: I only need 8GB for swap and even that is too much
Sep 17 14:11:33 <sudokode>	I use a 2GiB swap file with 8GiB of memory
Sep 17 14:11:38 <earnestly>	sudokode: Oh you're alive
Sep 17 14:11:41 <occultus>	eschwartz: actually, is this in all apps or just in firefox?

Sep 17 14:14:47 <sajattack>	yeah it might just be that it needs swap no matter how much ram you have

Sep 17 14:37:00 <grawity>	they all have the same gvfs support
Sep 17 14:37:00 <sudokode>	if you have a preferred FM, you can probably get it to use mtp somehow, but I've found pcmanfm to be the best light FM that supports most things plus tab
Sep 17 14:37:00 <sudokode>	tabs
Sep 17 14:37:00 <stranglerfish>	wow this works so much easier, out of the box
Sep 17 14:37:28 <stranglerfish>	i don't have a preferred fm i honestly am only ever gonna really use it for transferring music onto phone
Sep 17 14:37:31 <grawity>	KDE's kio-extras also has a mtp: plugin for Dolphin, also libmtp-based, but I've never tried it

Sep 20 20:44:39 <notmike>	krarkrrrc: wow, passive-aggressive much

Sep 20 20:45:03 <Brilpikk3wyn>	:)
Sep 20 20:45:42 <krarkrrrc>	notmike: just an observation, if the shoe fits
Sep 20 20:45:45 <Brilpikk3wyn>	joebobjoe, you generally shouldn't have to do it over an ssh tunnel

Sep 20 20:46:32 <amosbird>	ahh..
Sep 20 20:46:33 <joebobjoe>	it is just to get the drivers updated
Sep 20 20:46:34 <demonicm1niac3>	nuuu hy did hvariant leave 
Sep 20 20:46:46 <demonicm1niac3>	did anybody tell him to reinstall tzdata simply?
Sep 20 20:46:57 <amosbird>	I've raised every limit but it still crashes with platform_thread_posix.cc(119)] pthread_create: Resource temporarily unavailable
Sep 20 20:46:57 <Brilpikk3wyn>	you should connect the arch linux box to the internet instead
Sep 20 20:47:08 <Tendies>	is anyone familiar with what you can actually do with the selinux capability cap_fsetid? i don't know where to go since the information in the manpage doesn't help
Sep 20 20:47:10 <joebobjoe>	Brilpikk3wyn: I want to. but I need the wireless drivers
Sep 20 20:47:16 <Brilpikk3wyn>	then add a route to the gateway, and setup ip_forward
Sep 20 20:47:19 <joebobjoe>	and I want to do a full system update
Sep 20 20:47:28 <notmike>	krarkrrrc: its all love, positive vibes. I just hope you get the help that you need.

Sep 20 20:48:19 <Brilpikk3wyn>	the overhead will be VERY VERY heavy

Sep 20 20:48:29 <krarkrrrc>	you werent helpful and were actively demeaning, this is a help channel
Sep 20 20:48:47 <Brilpikk3wyn>	you don't need to use ssh tunnels for it
Sep 20 20:49:09 <Brilpikk3wyn>	perhaps create a bridge on the mac
Sep 20 20:49:10 <joebobjoe>	Brilpikk3wyn: then how will I do it without messing with my mac's firewall
Sep 20 20:49:19 <joebobjoe>	oh. ok I will try
Sep 20 20:49:50 <Brilpikk3wyn>	you can probably also setup basic routing with the mac, but i dont know how far gone it is from unix these days

Sep 20 21:29:36 <ConfusedUser>	Brilpikk3wyn: No
Sep 20 21:29:50 <demonicm1niac3>	n-iCe: that means there's a community project to take over maintenance of i686

Sep 20 21:30:02 <n-iCe>	Being updated? And all?
Sep 20 21:30:03 <demonicm1niac3>	i686 becomes an inofficial port
Sep 20 21:30:13 <demonicm1niac3>	depends on how many people they find working on it
Sep 20 21:30:16 <e36freak>	demonicm1niac3: there are MOS6502 port? wanna run it on my apple IIe

Sep 20 21:30:37 <demonicm1niac3>	you can check the arch-ports mailing list formore info
Sep 20 21:30:49 <demonicm1niac3>	otherwise simple and lightweight 32bit there's void

Sep 20 21:31:31 <demonicm1niac3>	puppy is not lightweight in any way 
Sep 20 21:31:33 <Brilpikk3wyn>	ConfusedUser, oh damn lol
Sep 20 21:31:34 <esph>	ConfusedUser: so you could alias that
Sep 20 21:31:38 <Brilpikk3wyn>	an actual tty?
Sep 20 21:31:40 <demonicm1niac3>	at least the official puppy ubuntu base
Sep 20 21:31:48 <demonicm1niac3>	and the idiocity of the old puppy to have only a root user default 
Sep 20 21:31:49 <Brilpikk3wyn>	pretty cool
Sep 20 21:31:53 <ConfusedUser>	Brilpikk3wyn: Yes
Sep 20 21:31:56 <demonicm1niac3>	void is runit and musl 
Sep 20 21:32:02 <demonicm1niac3>	it is as lightweight as it gets pretty much
Sep 20 21:32:06 <ConfusedUser>	esph: Tried, not work either
Sep 20 21:32:43 <esph>	ConfusedUser: what did you try exactly?
Sep 20 21:33:07 <esph>	Actually, rather than an alias, you should really just add that option to your config

Sep 20 21:34:45 <esph>	ConfusedUser: oh, you just can't get pinentry to work at all? Sorry, came into the conversation late and didn't read that far up
Sep 20 21:35:00 <Brilpikk3wyn>	it's not by any means the best solution, but you could run and X server on android
Sep 20 21:35:22 <Brilpikk3wyn>	and tunnel X11 onto your phone
Sep 20 21:35:24 <ConfusedUser>	Brilpikk3wyn: Hmm, good idea

Sep 20 22:39:02 <abdulhakeem>	that works!
Sep 20 22:39:14 <abdulhakeem>	so I guess I was overthinking it
Sep 20 22:39:28 <abdulhakeem>	or the wiki doesn't ever state "everything is self contained"
Sep 20 22:39:31 <jaawerth>	personally, for local dev of wordpress, I would probably prefer a virtualized/containerized solution via docker or vagrant so I could reliably develop in an environment that matches all the production versions

Sep 20 22:44:08 <codingquark>	Yesterday I had asked for help where my laptop uses up battery even when it is shutdown. People here told me to check if the battery gets used after doing the following: 1. Shutdown. 2. Remove AC supply. 3. Remove battery. 4. Put battery back in. I did this, and the battery remained charged. That means some device remains on even after system shutdown.
Sep 20 22:44:15 <codingquark>	How do I find out which device stays on?

Sep 20 22:47:36 <Brilpikk3wyn>	oh?
Sep 20 22:48:03 <jaawerth>	codingquark: you aren't, by any chance, dual booting with windows? perhaps windows 10?
Sep 20 22:48:24 <codingquark>	Yes. If I shutdown, the battery goes down by 20% over night. However, if I remove the battery, put it back it, it doesn't drain. jaawerth: not dual booting at all.

Sep 20 22:49:15 <Brilpikk3wyn>	i have encountered 2 laptops which for no logical reason, seem to drain battery when powered down ONLY if the tiny cmos battery is removed/dead
Sep 20 22:49:35 <Brilpikk3wyn>	this was about 3 years ago though, and is probably unrelated
Sep 20 22:49:46 <Brilpikk3wyn>	but strange problem calls for strange things to check :)

Sep 21 22:22:45 <Anatzum>	in my saned@.service file i created for systemctl It has User=saned, Group=saned. thats what the documentation wants at least
Sep 21 22:23:39 <sheep>	you can't actually prevent it from running anything other than saned without using a MAC framework, and those are tricky to set up
Sep 21 22:24:07 <sheep>	but having /usr/bin/nologin as its shell or /usr/bin/false would prevent users from logging in as saned
Sep 21 22:25:26 <bookworm>	couldn't one set up sudo so that only one command is allowed?
Sep 21 22:25:48 <sheep>	but why would another user sudo as saned?

Sep 21 22:26:49 *	pavlushka (~pavlushka@ubuntu/member/pavlushka) has joined
Sep 21 22:26:52 <sheep>	there are other ways. something running as root can setuid to sane
Sep 21 22:26:59 <sheep>	that's how su and sudo work
Sep 21 22:27:12 <sheep>	and also how systemd executes a process running as that user
Sep 21 22:27:20 <bookworm>	ah, thank you for the clarification
Sep 21 22:27:53 <sheep>	there's a difference between something like su, sudo, or systemd executing a command as a user and being able to get a login shell as that user
