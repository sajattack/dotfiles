Sep 20 14:52:23 <sajattack>	r3pek: yes
Sep 20 14:52:44 <r3pek>	well, the config is the same
Sep 20 14:52:49 <r3pek>	just add the ssl directives
Sep 20 14:53:03 <r3pek>	other then that, nothing else is needed

Sep 20 14:59:40 <r3pek>	actually

Sep 20 14:59:52 <r3pek>	in the a2enmod
Sep 20 15:00:03 <ibeardslee>	should be installed by default
Sep 20 15:00:07 <sajattack>	module ssl already enabled
Sep 20 15:00:27 <r3pek>	you need to check your logs then

Sep 20 15:02:10 <r3pek>	https://owncloud.paulsajna.com/index.php/login <----- it's redirecting there
Sep 20 15:02:19 <r3pek>	it's missing the /owncloud/

Sep 20 15:04:16 <r3pek>	config
Sep 20 15:04:37 <r3pek>	btw, your apache access_log and/or error_log should tell you what it's trying to access
Sep 20 15:04:51 <sajattack>	don't have that value set
Sep 20 15:05:28 <r3pek>	ok

Sep 20 16:13:56 <NextcloudBot>	hi mike_, please go ahead and ask your question and be patient, most people do not actively monitor the chat and will only check the chatlog periodically
Sep 20 16:14:11 <mike_>	I want to ask whether I should use APCu or Memcached
Sep 20 16:14:15 *	mike_ is now known as Guest47004
Sep 20 16:14:22 <Guest47004>	For single machine setup
Sep 20 16:15:14 <Guest47004>	I think redis is not for me because redis works better for multi server infrastructure
Sep 20 16:15:19 <Guest47004>	any ideas?
Sep 20 16:16:09 <ibeardslee>	https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/admin_manual/configuration_server/caching_configuration.html would suggest APCu
Sep 20 16:16:10 <NextcloudBot>	Title: Configuring Memory Caching — Nextcloud 12 Server Administration Manual 12 documentation (at docs.nextcloud.com)
Sep 20 16:17:27 <Guest47004>	Hi @ibeardslee, but if I only have 1.5G ram for php+webserver, should I use APCu+opcache or should I just run next cloud without caching?
Sep 20 16:17:40 <Guest47004>	I am the only user on the VPS, but I might sync a lot of small files

Sep 20 19:40:10 <dah85>	sajattack, are you willing to just set up nextcloud fresh and manually resync or do you have a lot of users, etc?
Sep 20 19:40:22 <sajattack>	I've never been able to get that to work
Sep 20 19:40:32 <sajattack>	for some reason I have to install owncloud first
Sep 20 19:40:34 <dah85>	RoyK, we're in for a heat wave in the next few days
Sep 20 19:40:45 <RoyK>	dah85: how hot?
Sep 20 19:40:49 <dah85>	sajattack, do you have access to another machine to do a test run?

Sep 20 19:41:02 <sajattack>	I don't really have any data to lose
Sep 20 19:41:08 <RoyK>	shit - I don't like it over 25
Sep 20 19:41:10 <dah85>	average temp this time of year is around 30ish
Sep 20 19:41:23 <dah85>	RoyK, we rarely get below 5c here though in winter ;)
Sep 20 19:41:43 <RoyK>	well, in .no, we rarely get below -50
Sep 20 19:41:46 <dah85>	sajattack, if that's the case, could i suggest setting up a fresh nextcloud install then and just sync your files to that when it's done
Sep 20 19:42:00 <RoyK>	in oslo, rarely below -20
Sep 20 19:42:09 <dah85>	RoyK, you can keep that lol. My wife is from Canada and she loves the weather here but still complains about the "cold" 10 degree days haha
Sep 20 19:42:11 <sajattack>	I've never been able to get a fresh nextcloud to work but I'll try
Sep 20 19:42:22 <dah85>	sajattack, what errors have you had when trying that?
Sep 20 19:42:35 <dah85>	what os are you using on your server?
Sep 20 19:42:42 <sajattack>	ubuntu 14.04
Sep 20 19:42:42 <RoyK>	dah85: andrew?
Sep 20 19:42:59 <dah85>	RoyK, my name? David
Sep 20 19:43:42 <RoyK>	ok, just know a guy from aussie-land with a wife from canada an was just wondering - if you're born in 85, he's a wee bit older, so to say ;)
Sep 20 19:43:46 <dah85>	sajattack, which method of installing did you try? through apt, the web installer or the zip?
Sep 20 19:43:55 <sajattack>	zip
Sep 20 19:44:13 <dah85>	RoyK, there's a lot of Canadian chicks here with Aussie husbands.. I guess they love the accent lol
Sep 20 19:44:28 <dah85>	sajattack, do you get as far as the setup screen?
Sep 20 19:44:40 <RoyK>	I used the zip installer when I migrated, but I beleive that was from oc v8
Sep 20 19:44:46 <sajattack>	is there an apt package?
Sep 20 19:44:49 <dah85>	if you can, it will usually tell you if there is anything missing dependency-wise
Sep 20 19:45:03 <dah85>	sajattack, i'm pretty sure there is.. try apt install nextcloud
Sep 20 19:45:12 <sajattack>	unable to locate package nextcloud
Sep 20 19:45:31 <dah85>	okay, so you've got apache installed?
Sep 20 19:45:39 <RoyK>	sajattack: afaics no - I'm just using the ones from nextcloud
Sep 20 19:45:40 <dah85>	and you unzip the files into your /var/www/html/nextcloud folder?
Sep 20 19:46:06 <sajattack>	nah I unzip to /var/www/owncloud.paulsajna.com/owncloud
Sep 20 19:46:08 <RoyK>	dump the db first
Sep 20 19:46:13 <sajattack>	I think that's the problem
Sep 20 19:46:15 <RoyK>	just to be sure
Sep 20 19:46:32 <dah85>	sajattack, that should work as long as your vhosts are set up in apache correctly
Sep 20 19:46:50 <RoyK>	dah85: iirc he said it worked well before the attempted upgrade
Sep 20 19:47:06 <RoyK>	but then, unzipping may put it in a subfolder if you're not careful
Sep 20 19:47:10 <RoyK>	might be just that
Sep 20 19:47:20 <dah85>	RoyK, true. I'm wondering if he can install nextcloud fresh and manually sync the files again since he/she has nothing important
Sep 20 19:47:29 <sajattack>	he
Sep 20 19:47:35 <dah85>	depends on the error he's getting
Sep 20 19:47:48 *	jadesoturi has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Sep 20 19:48:05 <dah85>	how about we try it on another folder.. if you leave the owncloud install there and unzip the nextcloud zip into a nextcloud folder
Sep 20 19:48:25 <dah85>	so from your example, /var/www/owncloud.paulsajna.com/nextcloud
Sep 20 19:48:53 <dah85>	and then point your browser to (i presume) owncloud.paulsajna.com/nextcloud and see what happens.. you should get the nextcloud setup screen
Sep 20 19:49:01 <RoyK>	I ran nc and oc in parallel for a brief time to make sure things worked well
Sep 20 19:49:11 <RoyK>	then shut down the oc shite
Sep 20 19:49:15 <dah85>	RoyK, that's what I did too.. in my case it worked out great
Sep 20 19:49:46 <dah85>	sajattack, is your server your own hardware or are you using a vps/etc?
Sep 20 19:49:50 <sajattack>	vps
Sep 20 19:49:58 <RoyK>	then snapshot it first
Sep 20 19:50:04 <dah85>	if you can
Sep 20 19:50:14 <sajattack>	don't think I can
Sep 20 19:50:19 <dah85>	i use serverhub for mine and there's no snapshot/backup
Sep 20 19:50:30 <RoyK>	sajattack: which provider?
Sep 20 19:50:33 <dah85>	but if you install them in parallel they should still work
Sep 20 19:50:40 <dah85>	without any data loss
Sep 20 19:50:45 <sajattack>	one sec I gotta reset my mariadb password
Sep 20 19:50:55 <dah85>	am i correct in presuming your files are backed up at least?
Sep 20 19:50:55 *	RoyK has been working with computing sufficiently long to appreciate a good backup
Sep 20 19:51:20 <dah85>	RoyK, amen to that. HDD failures are a biiiatch.
Sep 20 19:51:21 <RoyK>	and btw, use postgres, not m*db, the latter sucks
Sep 20 19:51:33 <dah85>	i've been using mysql with no issues
Sep 20 19:51:34 <RoyK>	dah85: I'm using RAID systems, still, things fail
Sep 20 19:51:45 <RoyK>	dah85: famous last words
Sep 20 19:51:47 <dah85>	yeah RAID won't protect from user error though
Sep 20 19:51:52 <dah85>	lol
Sep 20 19:51:55 <RoyK>	I know
Sep 20 19:52:02 <sajattack>	the docs I found use mariadb
Sep 20 19:52:08 <RoyK>	so RAIDz2 on my home server and database to the cloud
Sep 20 19:52:16 <dah85>	i find it easy to manage so i stick to it until it screws me over ;p
Sep 20 19:52:27 <RoyK>	sajattack: I use postgresql - I find that far more stable and versatile
Sep 20 19:52:55 <dah85>	that's the beauty of linux in general, so much choice and there is a never a right or wrong software to use (well, never say never, generally speaking..)
Sep 20 19:52:57 <RoyK>	I'm using postgres at work with some rather big stuff
Sep 20 19:53:59 *	rhabbachi (~rhabbachi@197.1.103.69) has joined
Sep 20 19:54:32 <dah85>	argh my nextcloud update got stuck at the backup stage.. time to troubleshoot.. bbl ;P
Sep 20 19:55:24 <RoyK>	- mysql is a network-attached spreadsheet used by pr0n sites and other dodgy entities across the Internet.
Sep 20 19:56:26 <sajattack>	lol
Sep 20 19:56:31 <dah85>	haha
Sep 20 19:56:41 <sajattack>	ok I got a fresh nextcloud up
Sep 20 19:56:47 <dah85>	sajattack, nice!
Sep 20 19:57:06 <dah85>	if you're happy to set it up as new, then add a user and sync to it and you should be sweet to go ;)
Sep 20 19:57:23 <RoyK>	as for mysql vs postgres - it isn't religion - I've been working with linux for over 20 years and I've seen mysql doing some rather nasty stuff
Sep 20 19:57:24 <sajattack>	can someone help me get it set to https?
Sep 20 19:57:38 <sajattack>	every time I try I get file not found
Sep 20 19:57:39 <RoyK>	sajattack: using apache?
Sep 20 19:57:42 <sajattack>	yeah
Sep 20 19:57:44 <sajattack>	and letsencrypt
Sep 20 19:57:51 <dah85>	sajattack, i have a trick to do that
Sep 20 19:57:55 <RoyK>	should be pretty straight forward
Sep 20 19:58:05 <dah85>	if you set up letsencrypt it will automatically set up https for you ;p
Sep 20 19:58:07 <sajattack>	http://termbin.com/3jry
Sep 20 19:58:29 <sajattack>	https://owncloud.paulsajna.com/index.php/apps/files/
Sep 20 19:58:43 <sajattack>	but http:// works
Sep 20 19:58:48 <dah85>	sorry for the shameless plug.. http://dah85.com/2017/04/setting-up-letsencrypt-free-ssl
Sep 20 19:58:51 <NextcloudBot>	Title: Setting up LetsEncrypt free SSL - dah85.com (at dah85.com)
Sep 20 19:59:12 <sajattack>	I've used letsencrypt before but nextcloud seems to hate it
Sep 20 19:59:19 <dah85>	after you do that, you should be able to access via https://blah
Sep 20 19:59:23 <sajattack>	I can't figure out why
Sep 20 19:59:31 <dah85>	try doing it this way
Sep 20 19:59:47 <dah85>	i found setting up https to be a pain but this is kinda like a magic bullet approach
Sep 20 20:00:02 <sajattack>	I've done it that way already
Sep 20 20:00:07 <dah85>	hmm
Sep 20 20:00:18 <sajattack>	think it could be my nextcloud/owncloud thing?
Sep 20 20:00:30 <dah85>	depends on your configuration perhaps
Sep 20 20:00:37 <sajattack>	move it to /nextcloud and redo the apache config?
Sep 20 20:00:46 <sajattack>	I posted my config
Sep 20 20:01:05 <dah85>	i'd try doing the letsencrypt --apache -d yourdomain.com approach
Sep 20 20:01:26 <sajattack>	ok
Sep 20 20:01:38 <dah85>	wait
Sep 20 20:01:46 <dah85>	i see your cert is good
Sep 20 20:01:52 <dah85>	it's a 404..
Sep 20 20:01:56 <sajattack>	yeppers
Sep 20 20:02:01 <dah85>	is that path correct?
Sep 20 20:02:04 <sajattack>	yep
Sep 20 20:02:08 <sajattack>	not anymore maybe
Sep 20 20:02:13 <sajattack>	I just moved it to /nextcloud
Sep 20 20:02:30 <dah85>	oh that would be why
Sep 20 20:02:38 <sajattack>	nah, it was like that before
Sep 20 20:02:51 <dah85>	so in your config it's all set to /owncloud
Sep 20 20:03:01 <sajattack>	yeah I'll fix that
Sep 20 20:03:12 <dah85>	i must be honest, apache config is not my strong area
Sep 20 20:03:37 *	jadesoturi (~jadesotur@unaffiliated/kfj) has joined
Sep 20 20:04:35 <dah85>	plus my nextcloud isn't using a virtual host
Sep 20 20:05:29 <dah85>	since it's an issue with setting up a vhost, maybe the folks in #apache can help?
Sep 20 20:05:44 <sajattack>	I don't think that's the issue
Sep 20 20:06:21 <dah85>	maybe it's a permission thing
Sep 20 20:06:30 <sajattack>	just renamed everything to nextcloud and same error
Sep 20 20:06:47 <sajattack>	all files are chowned to www-data
Sep 20 20:06:47 <dah85>	have you chmod the directory to www-root?
Sep 20 20:06:53 <dah85>	www-data sorry
Sep 20 20:06:58 <dah85>	hmm
Sep 20 20:07:23 <sajattack>	I posted my access.log earlier
Sep 20 20:07:25 <dah85>	if you cant access via http:// it's probably because you've got it set to enforce https
Sep 20 20:07:42 <sajattack>	I can access it via http:// but not https://
Sep 20 20:07:42 <dah85>	i must have missed it, sorry
Sep 20 20:08:25 <dah85>	that must be frustrating, i really wish i could help further :)
Sep 20 20:08:29 <sajattack>	http://termbin.com/ipq9
Sep 20 20:08:38 <dah85>	thanks
Sep 20 20:11:30 <sajattack>	nothing in nextcloud.log
Sep 20 20:11:45 <dah85>	the access log only shows the 404 but doesn't really show why
Sep 20 20:12:26 <sajattack>	yep
Sep 20 20:12:29 <sajattack>	not very helpful
Sep 20 20:12:37 <sajattack>	the error log doesn't have anything recent either
Sep 20 20:12:52 <dah85>	do you have any other https sites working on that vps?
Sep 20 20:13:01 <sajattack>	yes, quite a few
Sep 20 20:13:13 <dah85>	that makes it even more strange
Sep 20 20:13:17 <sajattack>	haha
Sep 20 20:13:26 <sajattack>	that's why I think it's a nextcloud problem
Sep 20 20:13:31 <dah85>	have you reached out to someone at #apache anyway?
Sep 20 20:13:38 <sajattack>	not yet
Sep 20 20:13:44 <dah85>	i've got mine working with https but admittedly not with a vhost
Sep 20 20:13:56 <dah85>	unless someone else in here with more apache experience can help out?
Sep 20 20:14:48 <RoyK>	I use certbot (former let's encrypt) with nextcloud
Sep 20 20:14:52 <RoyK>	works like a dream
Sep 20 20:15:14 <RoyK>	after all, nextcloud isn't even part of it, it's apache doing the crypto stuff
Sep 20 20:15:35 <sajattack>	shruggie
Sep 20 20:16:02 <dah85>	if you can experiment on another vps perhaps it's a stale config or something else?
Sep 20 20:16:28 <sajattack>	I only have the one
Sep 20 20:16:38 <sajattack>	I'm seeing if #apache can help
Sep 20 20:16:57 <RoyK>	sajattack: remove the https config and the redirects from the others and run certbot again
Sep 20 20:17:03 <RoyK>	sajattack: #httpd, that is
Sep 20 20:17:39 *	rhabbachi has quit (Quit: rhabbachi)
Sep 20 20:18:03 <dah85>	RoyK, i've found that letsencrypt automagically configured https for me
Sep 20 20:20:06 <RoyK>	it does
Sep 20 20:20:33 <RoyK>	but perhaps something went wrong, so i just thought you could try to reverse that and try again - make sure it's the latest version
Sep 20 20:24:01 *	pk12 has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Sep 20 20:27:08 <sajattack>	now that I think of it my letsencrypt version is probably pretty old
Sep 20 20:27:35 *	cyclux has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Sep 20 20:28:54 <RoyK>	sajattack: clone it from git
Sep 20 20:29:10 <RoyK>	don't use packages yet
Sep 20 20:29:27 <sajattack>	yeah that's what I'm doing
Sep 20 20:29:49 <RoyK>	it should update itself automatically if you run certbot-auto
Sep 20 20:30:35 <sajattack>	oh
Sep 20 20:32:34 <sajattack>	yeah no help
Sep 20 20:34:36 <RoyK>	what was the url again? just want to take a look
Sep 20 20:34:53 <sajattack>	http://owncloud.paulsajna.com
Sep 20 20:34:54 <NextcloudBot>	Title: Nextcloud (at owncloud.paulsajna.com)
Sep 20 20:34:55 <RoyK>	the bots will find it anyway
Sep 20 20:36:03 <sajattack>	should I change overwrite.cli.url to https://
Sep 20 20:36:06 <RoyK>	sajattack: I get a login from http:// but  blank screen from https:// - check the apache logs
Sep 20 20:36:14 <sajattack>	wait really
Sep 20 20:36:32 <sajattack>	I get login from http:// and 404 from https://
Sep 20 20:37:03 <dah85>	same, blank page on https
Sep 20 20:37:07 <dah85>	was getting a 404 before
Sep 20 20:37:11 <dah85>	http shows login screen
Sep 20 20:38:00 <dah85>	getting a different error on https now
Sep 20 20:38:07 <dah85>	shows the nextcloud screen but "file not found"
Sep 20 20:38:11 <dah85>	getting warmer ;)
Sep 20 20:38:11 <sajattack>	I wonder if mine is cached
Sep 20 20:38:15 <sajattack>	oh
Sep 20 20:38:17 <sajattack>	dns?
Sep 20 20:38:18 <sajattack>	lol
Sep 20 20:38:23 <sajattack>	always blame dns
Sep 20 20:38:27 <dah85>	did you change ip?
Sep 20 20:38:32 <sajattack>	no
Sep 20 20:38:33 <dah85>	if no then probably not dns
Sep 20 20:38:38 <RoyK>	hm - 404 on https, it is
Sep 20 20:38:43 <sajattack>	alright yeh
Sep 20 20:38:50 <RoyK>	it's not a nextcloud thing, it's just apache
Sep 20 20:39:01 <dah85>	yeah that's definitely an apache problem
Sep 20 20:39:02 <sajattack>	lol the apache guys say the opposite
Sep 20 20:39:05 *	Dominian has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Sep 20 20:39:19 <dah85>	they probably didnt troubleshoot to the level we have so far, i bet?
Sep 20 20:39:40 <dah85>	we've worked out that although nextcloud is the only thing not working on https, it works on http and it's a fresh install
Sep 20 20:39:54 <dah85>	at this stage it's pointing to an apache config issue
Sep 20 20:40:18 <sajattack>	go fight with #httpd :P
Sep 20 20:41:01 <dah85>	haha i used to work for applecare and the number of times we had people call up, referred by their isp who insist the issue is with their mac, for an ISP related issue like a password or something is incredible and they do no troubleshooting first
Sep 20 20:41:16 <RoyK>	dah85: check the nextcloud config - it has a home - that should be https://something
Sep 20 20:41:20 <dah85>	its just like "ahh you have a mac? call apple"
Sep 20 20:41:40 <dah85>	RoyK, was that for me or sajattack ?
Sep 20 20:41:52 <RoyK>	doh - for sajattack perhaps
Sep 20 20:42:00 <dah85>	lol
Sep 20 20:42:01 <sajattack>	overwrite.cli.url I just changed to https
Sep 20 20:42:04 <sajattack>	and it did nothing
Sep 20 20:44:13 *	cyclux (~cyclux@gateway/tor-sasl/cyclux) has joined
Sep 20 20:44:22 <RoyK>	sajattack: check apache's errorlog
Sep 20 20:45:40 <sajattack>	yeah there was nothing there until recently
Sep 20 20:45:58 <sajattack>	now there's some kind of sql error
Sep 20 20:46:17 *	Dominian (~dominian@opensuse/member/dominian) has joined
Sep 20 20:46:57 <RoyK>	sajattack: do you have separate log files for http and https?
Sep 20 20:46:57 <RoyK>	if not, do so
Sep 20 20:47:00 <RoyK>	then we can just just look for the errors in the https part
Sep 20 20:47:04 <RoyK>	a 404 will be logged
Sep 20 20:47:34 <sajattack>	the 404s are logged but there's nothing relevant
Sep 20 20:47:43 <sajattack>	like yeah, it tells me there's a 404 but that's it
Sep 20 20:47:50 <RoyK>	well, the path is relevant
Sep 20 20:48:00 <RoyK>	pastebin it

Sep 20 20:50:04 <sajattack>	here's one 
Sep 20 20:50:04 <sajattack>	158.36.144.162 - - [20/Sep/2017:20:44:08 -0700] "GET /index.php/login HTTP/1.1" 404 8664 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/603.3.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.1.2 Safari/603.3.8"
Sep 20 20:50:31 <dah85>	it finds index.php but then it redirects to index.php/index and then says not found
Sep 20 20:50:37 <dah85>	same thing for index.php/settings/admin/serverinfo
Sep 20 20:50:38 <sajattack>	really
Sep 20 20:50:57 <dah85>	i'd say you're very close to getting it working
Sep 20 20:51:03 <sajattack>	how do I fix that?
Sep 20 20:51:10 <dah85>	that's the million dollar question
Sep 20 20:51:16 <RoyK>	sajattack: that's me
Sep 20 20:51:49 <dah85>	my advice would always be to test on a fresh install
Sep 20 20:52:06 <dah85>	just to rule out any underlying issues which might be hiding away in a config somewhere
Sep 20 20:52:22 <RoyK>	dah85: I seriously doubt it's that bad
Sep 20 20:52:29 <sajattack>	where do you see it redirecting to index.php/index?
Sep 20 20:52:38 <RoyK>	sajattack: which distro is this?
Sep 20 20:52:39 <dah85>	when you go to your url
Sep 20 20:52:47 <sajattack>	ubuntu 14.04
Sep 20 20:53:01 <RoyK>	ok, do you have a "default" thing for https?
Sep 20 20:53:05 <RoyK>	if so, remove it
Sep 20 20:53:08 <sajattack>	huh?
Sep 20 20:53:25 <dah85>	it's loading index.php when you go to https://yoururl/
Sep 20 20:53:26 <RoyK>	just use specific virtualhosts
Sep 20 20:53:34 <dah85>	and index.php is loading the login page, which it can't find
Sep 20 20:53:50 <dah85>	is there anything in your nextcloud logs?
Sep 20 20:53:52 <RoyK>	older ubuntu is rather bad on the "default" thing - sometimes it just takes over
Sep 20 20:53:59 <RoyK>	for apache, that is
Sep 20 20:54:07 <sajattack>	oh, my 000-default.conf
Sep 20 20:54:25 <RoyK>	or 000-sslsomething
Sep 20 20:54:28 <RoyK>	don't remember it
Sep 20 20:54:35 <dah85>	there should be one that references ssl
Sep 20 20:54:36 <RoyK>	000-default.conf is the http part
Sep 20 20:54:40 <sajattack>	the #httpd guys are sassy
Sep 20 20:54:41 <dah85>	in the name like RoyK suggested
Sep 20 20:54:54 <sajattack>	ls
Sep 20 20:54:59 <sajattack>	oops
Sep 20 20:55:04 <RoyK>	remove it from /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
Sep 20 20:55:52 <sajattack>	apache breaks when I do that
Sep 20 20:56:06 <RoyK>	don't remove the dir
Sep 20 20:56:10 <RoyK>	remove the symlink
Sep 20 20:56:19 <RoyK>	just create a new vhost for that specific site
Sep 20 20:56:27 <RoyK>	or whatever other sites
Sep 20 20:56:27 *	vectr0n has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Sep 20 20:57:05 <sajattack>	remove the symlink from sites-enabled?
Sep 20 20:57:07 <RoyK>	older ubuntu is notoric on redirecting everything to the default site if something is non-optimal or even optimal
Sep 20 20:57:11 <RoyK>	yes
Sep 20 20:58:36 <sajattack>	didn't help
Sep 20 20:58:56 <RoyK>	did you do an apache2ctl graceful first?
Sep 20 20:59:03 <RoyK>	or restart apache?
Sep 20 20:59:08 <sajattack>	restarted apache
Sep 20 20:59:47 <RoyK>	pastebin your apache config for the vhost - both http and https

Sep 20 21:02:40 <RoyK>	doesn't look like it
Sep 20 21:02:45 <sajattack>	no
Sep 20 21:02:51 <RoyK>	do that
Sep 20 21:03:04 <sajattack>	if I do that I can't access the http:// which is the only one that works
Sep 20 21:03:20 <RoyK>	just try, please

Sep 20 21:07:51 <sajattack>	indeed
Sep 20 21:08:36 <sajattack>	I'mma go ahead and undo that
Sep 20 21:09:27 <RoyK>	how many other vhosts do you have on this thing?
Sep 20 21:09:32 <sajattack>	a lot
Sep 20 21:09:37 <RoyK>	on https
Sep 20 21:09:47 <sajattack>	5

Sep 20 21:48:16 <sajattack>	termbin.com/6dq9
Sep 20 21:48:55 <RoyK>	just check with the paths there
Sep 20 21:49:13 <RoyK>	compare them with the paths when accessing it over http as compared to https
Sep 20 21:49:47 <sajattack>	hmm?
Sep 20 21:50:10 <sajattack>	it doesn't log anything when I access over https
Sep 20 21:51:07 <RoyK>	wtf?
Sep 20 21:51:49 <sajattack>	there's nothing to log, it 404s before it can do anything
Sep 20 21:52:15 <RoyK>	I guess that *may* have to do with it ;)
Sep 20 21:52:25 <RoyK>	a 404 is logged in the access log
Sep 20 21:52:39 <sajattack>	yeah
Sep 20 21:52:55 <RoyK>	and if nextcloud doesn't log jackshit if accessed over https, it means it's not accessed
Sep 20 21:54:17 <RoyK>	nextcloud doesn't care about https - apache does
Sep 20 21:54:25 <RoyK>	so it's an apache issue
Sep 20 21:54:35 <sajattack>	lol
Sep 20 21:54:37 <RoyK>	what and why, I don't know
Sep 20 21:55:04 <sajattack>	fight it out with #httpd
Sep 20 21:55:47 <Lartza>	Yeah sounds like an Apache configuration issue at a glance, just woke up and haven't read the backlog :P
Sep 20 21:56:01 <sajattack>	could you try a fresh nextcloud RoyK?
Sep 20 21:56:15 <RoyK>	sajattack: well, I'm using a similar setup, but upgraded from oc8
Sep 20 21:56:17 <Lartza>	There's no way for NC to steal Apache logs, only PHP, and if you access a ssite it will log
Sep 20 21:56:25 <RoyK>	sajattack: try that
Sep 20 21:56:35 <sajattack>	try what?
Sep 20 21:56:47 <sajattack>	install a fresh owncloud 8?
Sep 20 21:56:49 <RoyK>	well, a fresh setup, but still
Sep 20 21:56:50 <RoyK>	well
Sep 20 21:56:52 <RoyK>	no
Sep 20 21:57:04 <RoyK>	I don't really know
Sep 20 21:57:07 <sajattack>	haha
Sep 20 21:57:13 <sajattack>	thanks for your help anyways
Sep 20 21:57:42 <RoyK>	still - does apache do php in https mode?
Sep 20 21:57:49 <RoyK>	are the rewrite rules there?
Sep 20 21:58:04 <RoyK>	et cetera et cetera ad infinitum
Sep 20 21:58:30 <Lartza>	Ouch I'm reading the backlog and everything now
Sep 20 21:58:40 <Lartza>	This is a fresh install now? Or are you on OC 10.0.3 or what

Sep 20 22:04:23 <RoyK>	sajattack: boost the logging to debug
Sep 20 22:04:38 <RoyK>	and use a separate logfile
Sep 20 22:04:52 <RoyK>	but then, you did that in the vhost, didn't you? for both err an acc?
Sep 20 22:05:20 <sajattack>	yeah
Sep 20 22:05:31 <sajattack>	the ssl log should be owncloud-ssl-error.log

Sep 20 22:05:58 <Lartza>	It's the same as the non-ssl log
Sep 20 22:06:04 <sajattack>	not anymore
Sep 20 22:06:08 <Lartza>	I see

Sep 20 22:07:52 <sajattack>	I don't see anything relevant in it
Sep 20 22:08:45 <Lartza>	Are you using mod_php?
Sep 20 22:08:53 <sajattack>	pretty sure
Sep 20 22:09:24 <Lartza>	And nextcloud log is not helpful either?

Sep 20 22:09:33 <sajattack>	*nope

Sep 20 22:42:10 <krzyzaq>	just migrated to nextcloud 11.0.5 from owncloud but can't access the server with my user from desktop client (the web works fine)
Sep 20 22:42:16 <krzyzaq>	Access forbidden by server
Sep 20 22:42:24 <krzyzaq>	what can be the issue?
Sep 20 22:42:34 <Lartza>	What do the NC logs say
Sep 20 22:42:48 <Lartza>	Also why NC11 and from what OC version?
Sep 20 22:44:27 <dah85>	krzyzaq, have you tried removing the account and re-adding it in the client?
Sep 20 22:44:40 <dah85>	did up also update to the nextcloud client? (even though the owncloud client should work)
Sep 20 22:45:52 <krzyzaq>	@Lartza: previous ver was (9,1,0,15) so the 11 was the highest stable available

Sep 20 22:49:18 <krzyzaq>	@dah85: sure, the old oc client doesn't work neither
Sep 20 22:50:08 <dah85>	did you try removing the account from the client and adding it again?
Sep 20 22:50:29 <Lartza>	Please don't use pastebin.com. Also NC12 is available but yes you had to update to NC11 first :) We are fine let's troubleshoot

Sep 20 23:12:02 <Lartza>	davdroid
Sep 20 23:13:36 <Lartza>	Because apparently that error might not matter
Sep 20 23:14:34 <Lartza>	Do you have two-factor auth enabled and would it be possible to try and re-add the user to the NC client?

Sep 20 23:24:12 <dah85>	Lartza, do you have another computer you can try the nc client on?
Sep 20 23:24:30 <Lartza>	Um?
Sep 20 23:24:32 <dah85>	or create a new user account on your computer and try it in there, just in case?
Sep 20 23:24:42 <dah85>	sorry, that was for krzyzaq
Sep 20 23:24:46 <Lartza>	:P
Sep 20 23:25:46 <dah85>	i suggested it about 40 minutes back and i'm not sure if you've tried it yet, krzyzaq
Sep 20 23:26:37 <krzyzaq>	@dah85: don't find a reason for a new user, since I can login to web interface
Sep 20 23:26:49 <krzyzaq>	I'm thinking about updating to 12
Sep 20 23:26:49 *	Ivansss (~ivansss@x4db132f7.dyn.telefonica.de) has joined
Sep 20 23:27:06 <dah85>	the web interface is one part of it, that works, but the client is where the issue is
Sep 20 23:27:22 <dah85>	so if we try it in another user account we can eliminate potential issues within the client
Sep 20 23:27:34 <dah85>	at the very least, remove the account from the client and add it again
Sep 20 23:28:54 <krzyzaq>	@dah85: nope, it also doesn't work
Sep 20 23:29:06 <dah85>	thanks
Sep 20 23:29:15 <dah85>	i wonder if it's a webdav issue then

Sep 20 23:32:33 <krzyzaq>	I've checked also php 5.6 and 7
Sep 20 23:32:38 <krzyzaq>	neither works
Sep 20 23:33:13 *	saiyan (~saiyan@mx0.chrstn.eu) has joined
Sep 20 23:33:31 <krzyzaq>	I think the last thing will be new/fresh install (loosing all shared files) or updating to 12?
Sep 20 23:33:37 <dah85>	could you try in another user account on your computer, or on another computer?
Sep 20 23:33:56 <dah85>	that would be easier and less destructive than wiping and starting fresh
Sep 20 23:35:11 <krzyzaq>	no can do now
Sep 20 23:35:21 <krzyzaq>	maybe in the afternoon
Sep 20 23:35:42 <dah85>	alternatively, try another nextcloud user account
Sep 20 23:35:46 <krzyzaq>	I would try first the most recent version of server
Sep 20 23:35:52 <dah85>	or that
Sep 20 23:36:02 *	fordfrog (~fordfrog@gentoo/developer/fordfrog) has joined
