Sep 10 18:47:29 <sajattack>	Hi I'm looking for a bug to work on
Sep 10 18:53:13 <arai>	have you tried http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/ ?
Sep 10 18:54:05 <sajattack>	yes, I found 1126144 but it looks like it might've already been completed
Sep 10 18:54:32 <sajattack>	I'm also looking at 1383562
Sep 10 18:56:35 <arai>	about bug 1126144, it's not yet fixed. there's work-in-progress patch
Sep 10 18:57:16 <arai>	(it's 2-years-old bug, so it might be nice to check if it's valid at first
Sep 10 18:57:27 <sajattack>	yeah, it looked like there was a test already written for it
Sep 10 18:58:08 <arai>	is it already in tree?
Sep 10 18:58:11 <sajattack>	on line 14 of browser_cmd_cookie.html
Sep 10 18:58:26 <sajattack>	there is a domain of .mochi.test
Sep 10 18:58:37 <sajattack>	the test case is a domain prefixed with "."
Sep 10 18:58:49 <arai>	https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/commandline/test/browser_cmd_cookie.html
Sep 10 18:59:17 <sajattack>	yes
Sep 10 18:59:52 <arai>	is the issue reproducible?
Sep 10 19:00:06 <arai>	there's steps to reproduce in comment #0 there
Sep 10 19:00:14 <sajattack>	I'm running a build right now to check
Sep 10 19:00:20 <arai>	great :)
Sep 10 19:00:45 <arai>	if the issue is no more reproducible, it would be nice to comment that.  they could close the bug
Sep 10 19:01:12 <sajattack>	I probably should've used artifact mode, this build is taking a while
Sep 10 19:02:16 <arai>	you can also use nightly to confirm the bug
Sep 10 19:02:37 <sajattack>	oh cool
Sep 10 19:03:02 <sajattack>	thanks for the tip

Sep 10 19:30:07 <db48x>	roc: incidentally, can you offer any advise for debugging malloc?
Sep 10 19:30:33 <db48x>	advice
Sep 10 19:31:21 <roc>	what do you mean by "debugging malloc"?
Sep 10 19:31:43 *	jrmuizel has quit (Connection closed)
Sep 10 19:31:49 <db48x>	I'm thinking that someone overstepped their bounds on the heap, and later malloc handed out some memory that was already in use

Sep 10 19:32:27 <roc>	data watchpoints and reverse-continue
Sep 10 19:32:32 *	spohl has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
Sep 10 19:33:04 <db48x>	exactly. the problem is that I don't actually know anything about the code
Sep 10 19:33:34 <roc>	if you're having trouble getting gdb to accept your watch command, compute the address (e.g. `p/x &foobar`) and then `watch -l *(long*)addr`
Sep 10 19:34:07 <db48x>	yes, that's what I ultimately did
Sep 10 19:34:09 <roc>	you need to narrow down the location of memory you think is corrupted
Sep 10 19:34:17 <roc>	I don't know how to help with that
Sep 10 19:34:28 <db48x>	ok :)
Sep 10 19:34:28 <roc>	once you have that, then working backwards to the corruptor is easy
Sep 10 19:35:20 <db48x>	I had hoped that you'd already done this, and you would know something about how libc works, and maybe even had some automation
Sep 10 19:35:56 *	ericjung_ (ericjung@moz-9pki1q.dyn.centurytel.net) has joined
Sep 10 19:36:00 <roc>	if you want automation for detecting heap overflows then ASAN/valgrind are the way to go
Sep 10 19:36:26 *	lizzard (ehenry@moz-bd77fr.ca.comcast.net) has joined
Sep 10 19:36:29 <db48x>	yea
Sep 10 19:36:31 <roc>	we could build a tool that lets you run valgrind-style analysis during a n rr replay
Sep 10 19:37:06 <njn>	roc: still talking about that, I see :)
Sep 10 19:37:09 <roc>	I have a lot of the infrastructure for that already built
Sep 10 19:37:15 <db48x>	:)
Sep 10 19:37:20 <roc>	but I can't afford to give it away :-(
Sep 10 19:38:04 <njn>	roc: you know that sewardj wrote valgrind because he was waiting for somebody to write an open-source version of Purify, but nobody was doing it, so he did it himself

Sep 10 19:39:12 <db48x>	I think what I want is a minimal tool that just knows about libc's malloc, and can tell me why the current call to malloc allocated the address that it did

Sep 10 19:41:00 <njn>	roc: not criticising, sorry it came across that way
Sep 10 19:42:14 <db48x>	I guess I'll either have to brave the (expected) storm of noise from valgrind, or try again to understand malloc
Sep 10 19:42:49 <roc>	njn: I wasn't sure what you meant really :-)
Sep 10 19:43:30 <njn>	roc: I guess the moral of the story is that if you don't give it away, there's a chance someone else will
